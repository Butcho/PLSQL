# PLSQL
In this repository I store all useful PL/SQL code I have written to solve problems I have faced.<br><br>
Folders:<br>
* Converters - tools to change base-2, base-10 and base-16 numeral systems, as well as deal with float and dates.<br>
* Plane Geometry - tools to compute distance, azimuth, line parameters, new points etc. for given geometric objects (lines, segments etc) on 2D plane.<br>
* SDO - tools to manipulate Oracle SDO geometry - get elements from SDO array, create new figures etc. Functions need additional numerical structure (NUMBER_ARRAY.sql).<br>
* Misc - other tools <br>

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.<br><br>
